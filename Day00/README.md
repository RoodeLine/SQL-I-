# Day 00 - Piscine SQL

## _Relational Data Model and SQL_

Resume: Today you will see how relational model works and how to get needed data based on basic constructions of  SQL

1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

People's visit and people's order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a customer can be in a restaurant (just looking at the menu) and at the same time place an order in another restaurant by phone or mobile application. Or another case, just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Write a select statement that returns the names of people (based on an internal query in the `SELECT` clause) who placed orders for the menu with identifiers 13, 14, and 18, and the date of the orders should be January 7, 2022. Be careful with "Denied Section" before your work.

Please take a look at the pattern of internal query.

    SELECT 
	    (SELECT ... ) AS NAME  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
    FROM ...
    WHERE ...

Use the SQL construction from Exercise 05 and add a new calculated column (use column name ‘check_name’) with a check statement a pseudocode for this check is given below) in the `SELECT` clause.

    if (person_name == 'Denis') then return true
        else return false

Let's apply data intervals to the `person` table. 
Please make an SQL statement that returns the identifiers of a person, the person's names, and the interval of the person's ages (set a name of a new calculated column as 'interval_info') based on the pseudo code below.

    if (age >= 10 and age <= 20) then return 'interval #1'
    else if (age > 20 and age < 24) then return 'interval #2'
    else return 'interval #3'

And yes... please sort a result by ‘interval_info’ column in ascending mode.

Please make a select statement that returns person names and pizzeria names based on the `person_visits` table with a visit date in a period from January 07 to January 09, 2022 (including all days) (based on an internal query in the `FROM' clause).


Please take a look at the pattern of the final query.

    SELECT (...) AS person_name ,  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
            (...) AS pizzeria_name  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
    FROM (SELECT … FROM person_visits WHERE …) AS pv -- this is an internal query in a main FROM clause
    ORDER BY ...

Please add a ordering clause by person name in ascending mode and by pizzeria name in descending mode.
